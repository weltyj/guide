## English Content Contributors

We need to keep the information updated with recent developments and recommendations. In this role you can edit any portion of content and create a pull request to have a reviewer confirm and approve your editing. All of the English content is located [here](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/tree/master/_content/en). There is a folder for each topic, under which there are files for each section.

### How to suggest an update or change

1. If you have never used Github and are not comfortable trying to do the update yourself, please go [here](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/issues/new/choose) and fiil out an issue with your content change request or submission: 
2. If you have used Github before and know what Markdown is, you can make the change yourself. 
3. Identify a section that needs to be added or modified.
4. Edit the content trying as best you can to match style and tone of the language used in that section - see instructions on how to edit content [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository).
5. Before submitting a change request, please [check the open pull requests](https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/pulls) to make sure that the same request has not yet been completed by someone else
6. Include a comment with a link to a trusted source or a justification for the change request
