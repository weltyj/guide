But keep in mind that over the longer term, this isolation could have\nnegative impacts on many people's mental health. Cultivating meaningful relationships is a well established but under-appreciated determinant for all health outcomes. So DO see the people you love, but consider doing so via lower-risk activities. For instance, go for a walk outside with a smaller group of people rather than attending an event indoors. Go to the beach. Ride bikes. Golf. Picnic more.

  "keep-your-home-clean": "{:.only_toc}\n## Your home\n\n{:.do.no_toc}\n## Keep your home clean and develop routines for coming back\n\nI'm developing guidance on this right now and others are welcome to weigh in, but a few things off the top of my head: If you have the ability to do so, consider a 'staging' area for clean entry into your home. Remove shoes, outerwear. If you work in a high risk environment like a hospital, nursing home, etc, wash your clothes immediately and then dry them at high heat or at least dry in the sunshine. Wash hands right away. Isolate your mail, packages and purchases (including food) before bringing them into the house and leave them isolated a few hours at a minimum. If you are in an especially high risk group, you might want to consider leaving goods isolated a longer time (a few days) and avoid eating raw produce, and also decontaminating products that come into your house.\nThe latest [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf) shows that the virus can survive up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel, and up to 24 hours on cardboard.\n\\[guidance needed as to how best to do this; what potency of bleach solution/duration etc?\\].\n",
  "look-beyond-yourself": "{:.do}\n## Look beyond yourself\n\nAt all times, be kind to each other and be mindful of other people's worries.

Same mentality is needed for climate change.](https://twitter.com/JasonWilliamsNY/status/1236332192172838912) Because travel is a big source of the spread, use the occasion to buy locally grown produce.

Stock the room in advance with food that the infected person can consume with zero preparation and without face-to-face interaction with others. If you have a dedicated bathroom for the infected person, that is best. Realistically, given shortages you won't have access to a mask, but if you do have one, prioritize its use on the infected person rather than caretakers.\n",
  "spread-the-word": "{:.only_toc}\n## Spread the word\n\n{:.do.no_toc}\n## Spread the word and lobby your reps for vital research\n\nIf it is any indication, the link tracking for this very guidance document (stats can be viewed at [bit.ly/corona-guidance+](https://bit.ly/corona-guidance+)) shows that the word is getting out on twitter, where scientists have a larger usership; however it is lagging on facebook and on direct shares where the general public need it most. Call a friend. Call your family. You will have the most influence on people you personally know. While there are certainly reasons not to panic, most people should be more concerned than they are. Raise the floor of awareness, not the ceiling; this will be much more effective in the long run.\n\n\"One aspect of that policymakers desperately need more information on is how readily children can transmit the virus. We know children experience\nmilder disease than adults but do they transmit to others?\" [There's been some seemingly contradictory evidence on this front so far.](https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1236286986161356801)\n\nIn the meantime, do your best to demonstrate, teach, and reinforce good hand hygiene for kids, but be realistic too. In the absence of a clear signal on the degree to which kids are vectors, keep your kids' fingernails (and yours) as short as is (safely) possible so that virus has fewer crannies in which to hide. I've stopped wearing rings for that same reason; I don't know that there's been a formal study on this ring idea.\n\nOnly if you are in a financial and operational position to do so, consider temporarily tutoring or home schooling, or even just keeping kids home from after-school activities or for part of the school day.Don't compromise your kids' education, but every little bit of distancing helps.

Don't believe individuals who say that crystals, essential oils, etc. have helped them; the folks sharing these products may have the best intentions, or they may be predatory. But the idea is the same: many patients spontaneously do get better on their own because most cases are mild and resolve without pharmaceutical intervention.

Time will tell.\n\nMoreover, even IF the true Covid-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% ([as it is so far with the Diamond Princess](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article)), that would already be [ten times higher than a typical seasonal flu](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).\n\n![The 61,099 flu-related deaths in the U.S. during the severe flu season of 2017-2018 amounted to 0.14% of the estimated 44.8 million cases of influenza-like illness. There were also an estimated flu-related 808,129 hospitalizations, for a rate of 1.8%.

Johns Hopkins University did a 3-year global survey of pandemic preparedness. Although the USA ranked at the top of the countries, even the US only [scored a 42 out of 100.](https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/pandemic-influenza-and-major-disease-outbreak-preparedness-in-us--7) We simply don't have the equipment, training, or messaging in place and\nwe need to ramp up fast. No one does. That is why your choices today matter so much.\n\nAnd those of us with Italian colleagues in the north (hit hardest) know they have exceptional physicians, infectious disease docs and\nimmunologists.

[People are therefore ignoring quarantine\n    because they need to eat.](https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/1236462655012917249)\n-   Many people are uninsured. Given where things are right now (cryptic transmission and no available vaccine), the insurance companies have\n    a moral obligation but have no financial incentive to improve testing and ensure access to care.\n-   In the USA insurance is tied to their employment, so when they get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy. In a pandemic year this is devastating for an economy.\n\nThe fact that these safety nets have not previously existed in the US complicates the behaviors required to #flattenthecurve compared to most other countries affected so far. However, legislation passed Friday by the US House of Representatives aims to address some of these critical issues. Namely, the bill will provide enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, and additional funds for food assistance and Medicaid. The bill is reported in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-relief-congress.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/coronavirus-relief-congress/index.html) and by other news organizations.

For a personal lens on\nthis, have a look [here](https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236467114933813248), but this is by no means unique; the accounts are flooding in.\n\nGlobally speaking, [authoritarianism can limit pandemic control](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/) since it can limit the expertise and transparency required for good decisionmaking, to make the best use of resources, and to communicate status to the regional and global citizens. Examples of this have been seen in China (earliest in the epidemic), and in Iran, Turkey and Russia, which until recently had reported the statistically unrealistic scenario of no cases. Country-specific US Embassy pages now are now reporting cases, for example [Russian Embassy](https://ru.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/). A number of effective data visualizations and world-wide case tracking are now available, for example at the [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and the [New York Times Coronavirus Case Maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)\n\n",
